# INTRODUCTION

## Average Length of Stay (ALOS)

The average length of stay is a broad term that that is used to evaluate
hospital efficiency and patient management. It mainly consists of two
kinds:

-   **Impatient Care Average Length of Stay**

-   **Curative Care Average Length of Stay**

Data regarding the above topic is found within the Healthcare
Utilization: Hospital aggregate data set. Click
[Here](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=30145) to view the
dataset.

This report focuses more on the Average length of stay in the
organisation for economic co-operation & development countries.

The code chunk written below will contains libraries that will be loaded
from respective packages which will be used on the course of this
Analytic report.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
pacman:: p_load(
  "rmarkdown", "tinytex", "tidyverse", 
  "knitr", "rmdformats", "visdat",
  "here", "finalfit", "gt", "janitor")
```

## Load Raw Dataset

This is the Hospital Aggregates raw data set which includes the Impatient
care Average length of stay and Curative care average length of stay
that will be extracted for insights

```{r message=FALSE}
# Importing and loading Hospital Aggregates Data set in a directory
Hospital_Aggregates_raw <- read_csv(here("Data/HU_HA.csv"))
```

## Raw Data Structure and Summary

Now let's look at the structure and summmary of our dataset and prior to
data cleaning

```{r message=FALSE}
# familiarizing and understanding the dataset
head(Hospital_Aggregates_raw)
# Visualizing the variable types
vis_dat(Hospital_Aggregates_raw)
distinct(Hospital_Aggregates_raw , Variable) # No. of Variables present
```

## Data Cleaning 1.0

The Hospital Aggregate raw data set is explored and wrangled to get
complete and sufficient data as the average days for both Inpatient care
ALOS and Creative care ALOS is determined in the last decade. Only countries with complete values in the last decade will be used in for further analysis. Those with NA or missing values are dropped out or filtered out.

```{r}
data_hg <- Hospital_Aggregates_raw %>% 
  select(Year, Country, Variable, Measure, Value) %>%
  filter(Variable %in% c("Inpatient care average length of stay (all hospitals)", 
                         "Curative care average length of stay")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!(year %in% c(2021:2022)) & !(country %in% c("Brazil",
                                                      "Bulgaria",
                                                      "China (People's Republic of)", 
                                                      "Croatia",
                                                      "Romania",
                                                      "Russia",
                                                      "South Africa"))) %>% # exclude all non-oecd countries
  drop_na() %>% #drop all rows with NA values 
  arrange(year)

data_hg %>% 
  distinct(measure) # check for distinct observation

data_hg %>% 
  tabyl(country) %>% # Tabulate the data by country and counts no. of values 
  filter(n < 22) # 22 values for each year and remove countries less than 22
   

mean_year <- data_hg %>% 
  filter(!(country %in% c("Canada",
                   "Chile",
                   "Colombia", 
                   "Denmark",
                   "Greece",
                   "Mexico",
                   "Netherlands",
                   "Slovak Republic"))) %>%
  group_by(year, variable, measure) %>% 
  summarize(mean_value = mean(value)) %>% 
  mutate(mean_value = round(mean_value, 1)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

## Vizualizing Average Length of Stay

A line graph showing the difference between the Curative care ALOS and
Inpatient care ALOS from 2010-2020.

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
gap_years <- seq(from = 2010, to = 2020, by = 1) # gap of 1 year from 2010-2020

  ggplot(mean_year, mapping = aes(x = year, y = mean_value, color = variable)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + geom_point(color = "black") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = gap_years)+ 
  geom_text(aes(label = mean_value, vjust = -0.3)) + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(title = "AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY",
       subtitle = "Curative care ALOS vs Impatient care ALOS in the Last Decade",
       x = "Year", y = "Average Days",
       caption = "source: https://stats.oecd.org
       Accessed Sunday 7th November, 2023")
```

From the Plot above, one can tell that Impatient ALOS tends to be higher
than the Curative ALOS. Going further, the two variables down trended as
years went by in the last decade with a marked uptrend in 2020. This is
sign that most OECD countries are doing fine in terms of Healthcare
efficiency

Overall, It shows that curative care could be a subset to inpatient care
since curative care may lead to inpatient care if triggered by some
factors and not the other way round.

## Pivoting from long to wide data

The dataset is currently a long data but we need to change to wide data
in other to access and easily wrangle the `Variable` and `Measure`
columns with there respective `Values`. At the end, the column names are
cleaned to snake case for better manipulation.

```{r}
# Pivoting from long to wide data
wide_data <- Hospital_Aggregates_raw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(Variable, Measure),
              values_from = Value,
              id_cols = c(Year, Country))%>% 
  clean_names() # clean names to lower and snake case for easy manipulation
```

## Data Cleaning 2.0

Now Data cleaning is done by selecting and renaming the main variables
for the report:

-   `Impatient Care Average Length of Stay`

-   `Curative Care Average Length of Stay`

The `year` and `country` variables are needed too during the analysis.

Going forward, since the report is on about the last decade, the year
2021 & 2022 is filtered out of the data and the Non-organisation for
economic co-operation & development countries (Non-OECD), thereby
isolating only the organisation for economic co-operation & development
countries (OECD) for the report.

All rows containing NA values are dropped as only countries with
complete data on the Inpatient ALOS Care and Curative Care ALOS are
needed for further analysis

```{r}
clean_data <- wide_data %>%
  select(year, country, 
         inpatient_care_alos = inpatient_care_average_length_of_stay_all_hospitals_days, 
         curative_care_alos = curative_care_average_length_of_stay_days)%>%
  filter(!(year %in% c(2021:2022)) & !(country %in% c("Brazil",
                        "Bulgaria",
                        "China (People's Republic of)", 
                        "Croatia",
                        "Romania",
                        "Russia",
                        "South Africa"))) %>% # exclude year: 2021-2022 a& all non-oecd countries
  drop_na() %>% # Drop all rows with NA values
  arrange(country) # Arrange by ascending order by default
```

It appears **Greece** and **Slovakia Republic** had empty cells for 5
years and a year respectively. So, we filter them out as other countries
with NA values has already been dropped too. All these filtering and
dropping helps to give a good sample of complete data to work with.

```{r}
# Check and view for missing value either in Impatient ALOS or Curative ALOS
clean_data %>% 
  tabyl(country, year) %>% # tabulates country on rows and year columns 
  View()

oecd_countries <- clean_data %>% 
  filter(!(country %in% c("Greece", "Slovak Republic"))) 
# Both countries had empty values in 1 or more years

# Cross check if code was successful
oecd_countries %>%
  tabyl(country, year) %>% 
  View()
```

# INPATIENT CARE ALOS

The Inpatient care average length of stay (ALOS) is a crucial metric
that measures the duration of a patient's hospitalization. It is often
used as an indicator of efficiency. Understanding the determinants of
ALOS can shed light on healthcare resource utilization, patient
outcomes, and the efficiency of healthcare delivery. This is done in a
hospital.

**Formula**:

**Total number of days stayed by all inpatients during a year** divided
by **the number of admissions or discharges**. The indicator excludes
days cases.


# CURATIVE CARE ALOS

Curative care, also known as acute care, is the type of medical care
focused on diagnosing and treating acute conditions or injuries. It
involves hospitalization and is generally aimed at providing immediate
relief and restoring health. This can be done in hospital, clinics,
homes etc. This technically means that the curative care ALOS is a
subset of Inpatient Care ALOS.

**Formula**:

**Number of curative care bed-days divided** divided by **number of
curative care discharge during the year**

----


# FACTORS AFFECTING ALOS & IT'S IMPLICATIONS


## Factors:

1.  **Severity and Complexity of Illness**: The severity and complexity
    of a patient's condition significantly impact the ALOS. Patients
    with more severe or complex illnesses such as cancer or
    cardiovascular disorders, tended to have longer hospital stays for
    diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring (Verweij *et al*., 2017).

2.  **Comorbidities**: The presence of comorbidities, which refers to
    the simultaneous occurrence of multiple medical conditions, can
    complicate treatment plans and extend the hospital stay (Rothberg *et al*., 2017).

3.  **Diagnostic Evaluations**: The length of hospital stay can be
    influenced by the time required to conduct diagnostic evaluations.
    Diagnostic procedures, including laboratory tests, radiological
    investigations, and specialized consultations, contribute to the
    ALOS (Gandelman *et al*., 2019).

4.  **Bed Availability and Resource Constraints**: Hospital resource
    availability, such as the number of available beds or healthcare
    personnel, plays a role in determining ALOS. When hospitals
    experience bed shortages or resource constraints, patients may
    experience longer waits for admission or discharge. Additionally,
    limited resources can impact patient flow, leading to extended stays
    (Hamblin *et al*., 2016).
    
    
## Implications:

The above factors has far-reaching implications on:

1.  **Healthcare Resource Utilization**

2.  **Cost Implications**

3.  **Patient Experience and Outcomes**

4.  **Capacity Management and Access**

# INPATIENT CARE ALOS vs CURATIVE CARE ALOS

From the data frame of the `oecd_countries`, the mean ALOS for
respective countries can be calculated by grouping by country and
summarizing the mean for both Impatient Care ALOS and Curative Care ALOS

```{r}
mean_oecd_countries <- oecd_countries %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_inpatient_care_alos = mean(inpatient_care_alos), 
            mean_curative_care_alos = mean(curative_care_alos)) %>% 
  mutate(mean_inpatient_care_alos = round(mean_inpatient_care_alos, 1), 
         mean_curative_care_alos = round(mean_curative_care_alos, 1)) %>% 
  arrange(country)
```

## Data Table

Now a glimpse of a structured table for the cleaned data set is
produced. A randomly selected rows of the data table
`mean_oecd_countries` can be seen and understood according to respective
variable.

```{r}
mean_oecd_countries %>% 
  slice(1:3, 15:17, 27:30) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Average Length of Stay in the Last Decade",
             subtitle = "The Mean Average Length of Stay in Randomly Selected OECD Countries") %>% 
  cols_label(country = "Country",
             mean_inpatient_care_alos = "Mean Inpatient Care ALOS",
             mean_curative_care_alos = "Mean Curative Care ALOS") %>% 
  cols_align(align = "center")
```


## Inpatient Care ALOS

**Plotting the Mean Inpatient care ALOS for respective OECD Countries in
the past decade**

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
ggplot(mean_oecd_countries, mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, mean_inpatient_care_alos), 
                                          y = mean_inpatient_care_alos, 
                                    group = country, fill = country)) + 
  geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_bw() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mean_inpatient_care_alos, vjust = 0.4, hjust = -0.1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Inpatient Care Average Length of Stay within the last decade", 
       subtitle = "Inpatient Care ALOS across the OECD Countries in Days", 
       x = "OECD Countries", y = "Inpatient Care Average Lenght of Stay",
       caption = "source: https://stats.oecd.org
       Accessed Sunday 17th November, 2023")
```

Although both curative care ALOS and inpatient care ALOS are dropping
over the years, countries such as `Japan` and `Korea` had the longest
Inpatient average length of stay with **29.6** and **17.4** days
respectively. Majority of the `countries` fell between **5.4** and
**9.6** days, with Turkiye standing out with the best Days of **4.1**

This means `Japan` and `Korea` has a poor healthcare efficiency and
patient management and would be needing more investment in to healthcare
facilities and resources from the health government to mitigate this
high days.


## Curative Care ALOS

**Plotting the Mean Curative care ALOS for respective OECD Countries in
the past decade**

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
ggplot(mean_oecd_countries, mapping = aes(x = reorder(country, mean_curative_care_alos), 
                                            y = mean_curative_care_alos, 
                                            fill = country)) + 
  geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_bw() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mean_curative_care_alos, vjust = 0.4, hjust = -0.1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Curative Care Average Length of Stay within the last decade", 
       subtitle = "Curative Care ALOS across the OECD Countries in Days", 
       x = "OECD Countries", y = "Curative Care Average Lenght of Stay",
       caption = "source: https://stats.oecd.org
       Accessed Sunday 17th November, 2023")
  
```

`Japan` still had the longest Curative care average length of stay with
**16.8** days

This is a confirmation that `Japan` has a poor healthcare efficiency and
patient management and would be needing more investment in to healthcare
facilities and resources from the health government.

It appears Turkiye is still the best overall with just **4** days,
followed by Australia and Israel. This signifies a very productive,
organised and efficient healthcare system.

# TRENDS IN ALOS

I.  **Advancements in Medical Technology**: 

II.  **Shift to Ambulatory Care**

III.  **Enhanced Discharge Planning**

IV.  **Emphasis on Home Healthcare**


## Trend 1.0

**Visualizing the Trend between Inpatient average length of stay and
Curative care average length of stay in the OECD Countries from
2010-2020**

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
ggplot(oecd_countries, mapping = aes(x = curative_care_alos, 
                              y = inpatient_care_alos)) +
geom_point(aes(color = country)) + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + 
geom_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE) + theme(legend.position = "none") +
labs(title = "Impatient Care ALOS vs Curative Care ALOS (OECD Nations) ", 
       subtitle = "Trend Between the Curative Care ALOS and Inpatient Care ALOS in the last decade", 
         x = "Curative Care ALOS", y = "Inpatient Care ALOS", 
       caption = "Source: https://stats.oecd.org")
```

Majority of the data point ranged between **3.9-12** and **3.9-10** days
for *Inpatient care ALOS* and *Curative care ALOS* respectively, with
data points from `Japan` and `Korea` looking like outliers from the rest
of data points from other `countries` as a result of their higher
Inpatient average length of Stay in Hospitals.

The General linear model method checks for correlation between the
Impatient ALOS and Curative ALOS for respective countries. This
concluded that there is a positive correlation between the Curative Care
ALOS and Inpatient Care ALOS


**Visualizing the Trend between Inpatient average length of stay and
Curative care average length of stay in the OECD Countries for each
years**

```{r fig.height=11, fig.width=14}

       caption = "Source: https://stats.oecd.org")
```


## Significance

The above plots indicating trend lines proves that the both curative
care ALOS and inpatient care ALOS has a positive correlation and it
statistically proven with a low `p-valve` of `0.001`. This means that as
Curative care ALOS decrease, Inpatient care ALOS also decreased
respectively, and an increase in one variable could also result in a
increase in the other.

The above plots still proves that the curative care ALOS has a positive
impact on the inpatient care ALOS and it statistically proven with a low
`p-valve` of `0.001`

```


# CONCLUSION

It was observed that as Curative care days dropped, Inpatient care days
dropped as years went on across most countries. This indicates a
positive correlation between the two variables.

This could mean that aiming for shorter Curative care days could further
shorten the Inpatient care days since the former can be a subset of the
later thereby improving healthcare efficiency in a given country and
across the globe.

Some of the times, Patients who require curative care could end up
receiving impatient care due to some of the factors that can increase
the length of stay. This is are most time beyond the hospital power and
could have negative impact on the healthcare system.

# RECOMMENDATION

Recent trends signify a shift towards shorter hospital stays due to
advancements in medical technology, increased emphasis on ambulatory
care, improved discharge planning, and the integration of home
healthcare services (Curative Care).

As healthcare continues to evolve, improving efficiency and reducing the
ALOS should remain a priority to enhance patient outcomes and optimize
resource utilization.

Healthcare Researchers can understand ALOS in hospitals and know that
the inpatient care ALOS is the major indicator for efficiency.

Although Having fully equipped hospitals settings is paramount to 
measuring the Inpatient Care ALOS, investment into curative
care by integration of home care services and more ambulatory care is a
big advantage as this can positively impact Inpatient ALOS days by
reducing the amount of beds occupied my patients, thereby facilitating
better patient management for the few admitted patient. This topic
appears to be statistically proven.

-    Well at some point, I thought why did I focus on just the OECD countries and leaving out the Non-OECD countries? Perhaps I could find some hide pattern or information. I just thought it will make the report lengthy, so i just included data from there in the last scatter plot

-    I had to filter out few countries out of the data set as I wished to work with a complete data set. Although I felt it could be bad at the beginning, it turned out all fine as it helped me focus on limited countries with complete data.

-    During the analysis, I came to understand the importance data quality collection, as it could help scientist better understand the data better and how handy data manipulation tools can be to wrangle and transform data to extract insights and patterns. Academically, I see the significance of data and knowing your audience and professionally, I think critical thinking necessary to survive in the field of data science. 

-    Inclusion from my reflection, I have come to understand the importance of working as a team to help utilize energy, skill and focus on respective task goals, because data is big and still growing enormously. I also see why story telling is important because it shows one's communication skill from the analysis/report generated.

-    I think I need to practice more R programming skill and improve my critical thinking to help me speed up my data manipulation and interpretation ability.
